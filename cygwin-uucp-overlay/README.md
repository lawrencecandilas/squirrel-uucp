These files contain two things:

1. UUCP binaries compiled under Cygwin.  Original source is on [Ian Taylor's website](https://www.airs.com/ian/software.html).  A Github mirror of the source is available [here](https://github.com/quinot/taylor-uucp) - a mirror maintained by [quinot](https://github.com/quinot).

2. The `uucico-bridge` script that UUCP Squirrel Caller uses to invoke UUCP binaries also lives here (in /usr/local/bin).

The idea is that you can take this entire directory structure and overlay it over an existing Cygwin installation, and then your existing Cygwin installation is ready to use with UUCP Squirrel Caller.
