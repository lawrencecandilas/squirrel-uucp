These files contain binaries compiled under Cygwin, acquired from [quinot](https://github.com/quinot)'s [Github repo of the Taylor UUCP source code](https://github.com/quinot/taylor-uucp).

The `uucico-bridge` script that UUCP Squirrel Caller uses to invoke UUCP binaries also lives here (in /usr/local/bin).

You can take this entire directory structure and overlay it over an existing Cygwin installation, and then your Cygwin installation is ready to use with UUCP Squirrel Caller.
